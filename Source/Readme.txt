Main Menu Controls
up arrow select singleplayer
down arrow select multiplayer
enter enter game in selected mode

entering a single player game will open a dialog box for setting up a single game

you will need to set an AI to a team num that is different from your own, default is team 0, teams go from 0 - 9 but 8 and 9 have the same colors as two teams from 0 - 7 so just use 0 - 7

lives is defaulted to 0 as well, and it is the current number of lives, it includes current life as well, however, a player will only die for good if they have 0 hp after dropping to 0 or less lives so you can leave at 0 if you want no one to have a second chance. Max lives is 99 you can have a higher number in there but it will only take the first two digits

name, does not matter truthfully, atleast not when this readme was writen you can leave blank or type something will have no real effect, the player will just store that name

by default only player2 is active, and all shiptypes are set to standard, these can be changed by using the radio buttons on this screen.
